	abstract = {Relational machine learning studies methods for the statistical analysis of relational, or graph-structured, data. In this paper, we provide a review of such statistical models can be 'trained' on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's knowledge vault project as an example of such combination.},

@article{Storey1993,
	abstract = {To develop sophisticated database management systems, there is a need to incorporate more understanding of the real world in the information that is stored in a database. Semantic data models have been developed to try to capture some of the meaning, as well as the structure, of data using abstractions such as inclusion, aggregation, and association. Besides these well-known relationships, a number of additional semantic relationships have been identified by researchers in other disciplines such as linguistics, logic, and cognitive psychology. This article explores some of the lesser-recognized semantic relationships and discusses both how they could be captured, either manually or by using an automated tool, and their impact on database design. To demonstrate the feasibility of this research, a prototype system for analyzing semantic relationships, called the Semantic Relationship Analyzer, is presented. {\textcopyright} 1993 VLDB.},

@article{Wang2013,
	abstract = {Based on VANETs (Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks), a stable, reliable and low delay wireless network access environment is an inevitable element of vehicle safety applications. The IEEE 802.11p is a specially designed protocol for ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) for V2V and V2I communication. It provides 10MHz channel bandwidth and up to 27-Mbps data transmission rate. This paper analyzes the theoretical throughput and delay limit of the 802.11p protocol. Considering PLR (Packet Loss Rate) and delay of VANETs, we analyzed the theoretical highway capacity upper limit of 802.11p for V2V communication. The results show that 802.11p communication technology can increase highway capacity. If all of the vehicles are equipped with 802.11p communication technology, the increase in highway capacity is about 491 percent.},
